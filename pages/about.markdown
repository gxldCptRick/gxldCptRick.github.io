I am a software engineer who currently works on a system built from many FastAPI applications. 
My primary focus day to day is writing and maintaining Python Code currently version 3.10.x but 
I do understand and work with other languages from time to time such as javascript using the Node runtime 
and C# using dotnet core.

This is a collection of my thoughts and lessons learned over my short time working at Level Home MDU, Formerly known as Dwelo
and the things I have been able to pick up through rigorous studying and paying close attention to detail.

I love to learn new tools and methodologies and I want a place where I can put those ideas to paper in my own words to learn 
how to express myself in the same medium of code that my cohorts can and hopefully I can use this to allow myself to connect 
to like minded individuals.
