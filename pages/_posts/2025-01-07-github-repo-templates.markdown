Github Repo Templates is a useful tool that can allow you to be able to use a repo as a template to create more repos exactly like it. There are other cool features such as being able to copy all the branches and what not but honestly it is most useful when using a repo to build out an example project in whatever language you primarily use for your projects so you can spend time refining your github repo with templates and workflows and actions and even code scanning. It is key to making each other project you work on easier and easier by lowering the cost of making an effective repo. The main thing we want to express is that this is a lot of work with the pay-off being a thing we can use over and over and over again without needing to do that much work. It is like trying to sell making your own templates for a word doc or using a template for google sheets. Templates are useful because they fill in so much around what you need and so using that same idea we can improve our code and projects by leveraging the fact that they will all be so similar.
