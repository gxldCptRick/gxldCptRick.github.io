Hey All, Today I wanted to talk about the different things I have been up to working on!! I have recently and just finished my first week. So far it has gone a little slow but it is nice to try and figure out how to manage my time with school. The good thing is I have a ton of knowledge in tech which helps me be able to finish more of these intro things rapidly and get stuff done sooner rather then later when it comes to school. But today I wanted to talk about some of the important stuff I went over in class specifically around the wide world of AI. We will be going over: What Kinds of AI are There, What is an LLM, and end with General Thoughts on AI and Its place in the Workplace.

## What Kinds of AI are There

With AI there are generally three buckets they get dropped into: Narrow, General, and Super AI. For more info please refer to [here](https://codilime.com/blog/types-of-artificial-intelligence/#AI-evolution-stages). But from a high level Narrow AI represents AI that we have now think ChatGPT and Google Gemini. AI that is trained to do a specific task and it knows how to do it well but it doesn't have the ability to adapt to new ideas without needing to be fully retrained by a human. General AI is kind of like the name suggests and represents AI that can start teaching itself new things but about the same pace as a person can. These AI are still just a dream but we are working diligently everyday to get closer and closer to that dream. So then it follows that Super AI is AI that is way faster then a person at learning new things while still being self sufficient. Think of this as Skynet or the robots from terminator these are the ones that people worry about and are afraid of. If we aren't even close to General AI we are leagues behind Super AI.

## What is an LLM

LLM or Large Language Model represents the work that ChatGPT and Google Gemini are doing they are basically models that we can talk to and is able to parse and reason from text responses. For more info checkout this article from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/). What I want to focus on is how we would go about parsing a sentence structure. For example: the cat bit the dog and the dog has been bitten by a cat. For us the meaning is more or less the same that there is a dog and a cat and the cat bites the dog. But to be able to parse and understand this is the goal of the LLM. It has to take these different structures that can change the form of the text but does not change the meaning in a significant way to change what they want from the text. It is really cool to toy with and play with LLM's and I recommend that you have a chance start playing around with ChatGPT and ask it the same question in different ways. You can then hopefully begin to see the pattern in the noise of the responses it gives and who knows maybe you can figure out the edges of reasoning that it might not be able to understand yet.

## General Thoughts on AI and its Place in the Workplace

With all these topics I have been able to cover my feelings on AI remain the same. AI is a tool used to be able to learn from the work that we as people have done. It is so useful to have that work be able to use to train a machine to start thinking like the person the work was based on and honestly if we could get to the point where we can train our own personal models we would have the ultimate assistant. I see this as the ultimate dream of what I wanted from machines. Creating an assistant that fully understood how I do things that would be able to do them with me and write together. They would be able to work with me to get things done faster because we know exactly where we are going and we know what needs done to the point that we are like the perfect duo writing things for each other to amplify the other. Basically AI should be used to empower people to move faster then they would alone. I think the fear of AI being used to replace a person is valid but we should move forward with the understanding that AI is not meant to replace the individual but instead push them further then they would be able to otherwise. The engine revolutionized the way we move across the world and I think AI can revolutionize the way we are able to work and help people focus on the things that matter the most. We shouldn't use it AI to replace thought but instead use it to replace tedium and I think we have a good starting point to be able to build towards that dream of help even if the road there is going to lead to abuse from a large section of people at first.
