So today I wanted to look back on the work I did to design my github profile and share it so that hopefully even more poeple can come to learn how to customize their own profiles using markdown. This is a feature that you can use if you create a repository that is your github username. After that you just add a README.md markdown file and you can make it look however you wanted.

This is the starting point that I will be working from. As you can see I used a mix of emoji's and different headings. I like the overall idea I was going for with clear sections for what I am doing but I want to expand it to have a little more personality.

Because it is markdown that means we can modify it using the same tools we have for html pages. That includes scripting probably if not you can probably add a script tag for to load more items and allow it to have some cool ideas. I thought maybe I could do something to render and play a simplified version of my chasing game. Problem is that you only get access to html and css so you can only add interactions based on css and html and not any of javscript.

After trying to add a script tag I went to checkout if my canvas was rendered the way I expected it too be with a green rectangle. When I saw it on my page I found the script tag being rendered as raw text!!! So sadly you can't add any behaviors to your github profiles but honestly I am glad its that way since that also means your profile page can't be used to abuse other peoples machines for trying to do something dumb like crypto mining or an annoying pop up to trick a user into thinking they have been hacked when in reality it was just a jerk leaving an annoying trickester in their readme.

Overall After getting saddend by that I think I will just keep the readme as is for now and maybe work on getting better images so that I can have a new updated banner for me. Thanks for reading and I hope you go out and make your own github profile that looks freaking awesome!!!
