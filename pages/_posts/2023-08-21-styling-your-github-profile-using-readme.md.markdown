So today I wanted to look back on the work I did to design my github profile and share it so that hopefully even more poeple can come to learn how to customize their own profiles using markdown. This is a feature that you can use if you create a repository that is your github username. After that you just add a README.md markdown file and you can make it look however you wanted.

This is the starting point that I will be working from. As you can see I used a mix of emoji's and different headings. I like the overall idea I was going for with clear sections for what I am doing but I want to expand it to have a little more personality.

Because it is markdown that means we can modify it using the same tools we have for html pages. That includes scripting probably if not you can probably add a script tag for to load more items and allow it to have some cool ideas. I thought maybe I could do something to render and play a simplified version of my chasing game.
