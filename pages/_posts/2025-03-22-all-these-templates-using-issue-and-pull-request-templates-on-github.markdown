Today I wanted to talk about templates haha. They are a useful idea to be able to kick start any writing project. They guide you and give you ideas to work with so you don't have to start with a blank page. No matter what kind of writing you do it is nice to be able to have something to build on instead of nothing and needing to pull a ton of things together. For this reason I wanted to talk about how you can create a template to use for your Github Issues and PR's!!!
