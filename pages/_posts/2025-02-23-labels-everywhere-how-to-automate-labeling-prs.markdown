Labeling PRs is a great way to go about making it easier to triage the importance of dealing with code reviews. In an ideal world we would be able to clear every PR from our repo but it is important to be able to quickly find and fix any issues that come up first over adding new features. That being said there is also great value in labelling PRs to be able to add extra context so that people who can help will be able to properly as well as helping building out changelogs and what not. Because these tags are so useful we would like to use them consistently and that means have a tool to figure out good tags to add to your PR for you automagically.
