Today I want to talk about mentorship. I have had experience being on both sides as a mentor and mentee and wanted to write up some thoughts I have about how to be a better mentor for people and finding the right way to be able to work and develop the relationship. When it comes to mentoring it is important that both people put in the effort to help each other grow. Whether you are guiding or being guided each person gains something in the process of mentoring. It can be a small thing if the relationship isn't built in a useful way or it can be a very deep and make you grow exponentially as individuals. Either way I recommend going through this expereince if you can and I want to tell you about mine in hopes you can find some tools to help you have the best experience you can.
