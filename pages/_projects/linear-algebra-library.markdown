## Overview
This project was an implementation of the lessons learned during my time in my Linear Algebra class at [Neumont College of Computer Science](https://www.neumont.edu/). I created a library with other students to be able to fully understand what the different transformations in class we learned were and then I also created a small entrypoint through the cli to be able to use it during my tests since we could use any code that we developed at my college to help you answer your tests.

## Languages and Tools
This was written using `C#` on `.Net Framework v4.7.2` using the best principals I had at the time the code was written. We also have a test harness that using the MSTest Framework. We have validation on the behavior of the mathematics.
